## Overview

Worked as a Full Stack Developer building a production-grade platform to orchestrate an end-to-end audiobook processing workflow, prioritizing **reliability**, **security**, and **high-throughput processing**.

## What I did

- Built a React 19 + TypeScript UI (React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS) and backend services in Python and TypeScript on **Cloudflare Workers + Wrangler**.
- Implemented **JWT authentication** and role-based API access, and stored user profiles + audiobook job metadata in **PostgreSQL**.
- Designed high-throughput ingestion and processing APIs integrating **Mistral OCR** and **OpenAI** services to improve text extraction quality for downstream synthesis.
- Containerized services with **Docker** and deployed on **AWS** to support large-scale PDF, OCR, and TTS workloads.
- Managed code with Git, documented APIs/workflows using **MkDocs**, validated endpoints with Postman, and shared progress through reports and demos.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM
- **Backend**: Python, TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers (Wrangler)
- **Data**: PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Mistral OCR, OpenAI
- **Cloud/Ops**: AWS, Docker, Git, MkDocs, Postman
