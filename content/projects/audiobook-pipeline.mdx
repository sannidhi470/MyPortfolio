## Overview

Worked as a Full Stack Developer building and maintaining an end-to-end audiobook pipeline, prioritizing **availability**, **performance**, and **operational reliability**.

## What I did

- Built and maintained backend services (Java/Spring Boot, Node.js) and frontend interfaces (Angular).
- Architected AWS infrastructure (Lambda, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB) to support high-performance APIs.
- Implemented monitoring/telemetry (Grafana) and performance optimization to improve resiliency.
- Containerized services with Docker and deployed on AWS ECS with automated CI/CD (GitHub).
- Integrated AI model APIs to improve text extraction and chapter detection quality.
