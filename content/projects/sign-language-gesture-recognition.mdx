## Overview

Built an AI-powered, real-time sign language recognition system and compared multiple CNN architectures with transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning.

## Highlights

- Trained and evaluated **LeNet**, **VGG**, and **ResNet** variants.
- Used **transfer learning** for improved accuracy and faster convergence.
- Achieved strong results, including **99% accuracy** on a hand-gesture dataset with ResNet-18.

## Tech stack

- **ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **CV**: OpenCV
- **Languages**: Python
